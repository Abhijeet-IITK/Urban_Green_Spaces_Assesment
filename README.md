# Urban_Green_Spaces_Assesment
This project aims to estimate Urban Green Space (UGS) within the wards of Raipur Municipal Corporation (RMC) using ESA Copernicus Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Urban green spaces, including parks, forests, and isolated trees, are crucial for improving environmental quality and public health.
Urban green spaces play a pivotal role in enhancing air quality, mitigating urban heat islands, supporting biodiversity, and improving mental well-being. With urban areas projected to house 60% of the global population by 2030, managing green spaces is essential, especially in rapidly urbanizing regions such as developing countries. The Smart City Mission by the Government of India emphasizes the need for better infrastructure and quality of life through improved urban environments.

# Objectives:

    Estimate UGS: Measure and analyze the extent of urban green spaces in Raipur using Sentinel-2 imagery.
    Compare Standards: Evaluate the UGS data against WHO recommendations and Indian smart city standards.
    Improve Quality of Life: Contribute to better urban planning and management strategies for enhancing green spaces and overall urban quality.

# Tools and Data:

    Remote Sensing Data: ESA Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery.
    Software: Geographic Information System (GIS) for data analysis and visualization.
    Standards for Comparison: World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and Indian smart city standards (URDPFI, 2014).

# Significance: 
  
  This study provides critical insights for urban planners and policymakers to improve green space management, ensuring sustainable development and a better quality of life in     urban environments.
